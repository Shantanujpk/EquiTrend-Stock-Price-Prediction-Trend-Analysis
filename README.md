📈 Stock Market Analysis and Prediction
📌 Description

This project analyzes historical stock market data and implements predictive models to forecast stock prices. It includes:
Data preprocessing
Visualization of stock trends
Predictive modeling using ML algorithmsThe goal is to generate actionable insights for investment decisions.
📁 Files in the Repository

1. AAPL.csv

Description: Historical stock data for Apple Inc.
Columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
Purpose: Used for exploratory data analysis and visualization of Apple's stock.
2. HistoricalData_*.csv

Description: Additional historical data for other stocks or indices.
Columns: Similar structure (Date, Open, High, etc.)
Purpose: Cross-company comparison and additional model testing.

3. Demo.ipynb
Purpose: Presentation-friendly summary notebook.

Contents:

Loads data and handles missing values
Visualizes stock trends (line charts, candlestick plots)
Performs basic EDA and statistical summaries
Use Case: Ideal for demonstrations or quick reviews.

4. StockMarketProject.ipynb
Purpose: Main notebook with full model development and technical analysis.
Contents:

Data preprocessing (missing values, feature creation)
Technical indicators: Moving Averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands
ML models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM (if applicable)
Model evaluation: RMSE, MAE, predicted vs. actual plots

Use Case: For deep dive analysis and implementation.

🧰 Steps to Run the Project
✅ Dependencies
Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow or pytorch (if applicable)

▶️ Execution

Load either AAPL.csv or HistoricalData_*.csv

Open:

Demo.ipynb for a high-level overview, or
StockMarketProject.ipynb for full analysis and prediction
Run the notebook cells sequentially:
Preprocess → Visualize → Train → Predict

⚙️ Customization
Replace datasets with other stock data (same format)
Modify model parameters or add new features to improve accuracy
