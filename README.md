üìà Stock Market Analysis and Prediction

üìå Description

This project analyzes historical stock market data and implements predictive models to forecast stock prices. It includes:

Data preprocessing

Visualization of stock trends

Predictive modeling using ML algorithmsThe goal is to generate actionable insights for investment decisions.

üìÅ Files in the Repository

1. AAPL.csv

Description: Historical stock data for Apple Inc.

Columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume

Purpose: Used for exploratory data analysis and visualization of Apple's stock.

2. HistoricalData_*.csv

Description: Additional historical data for other stocks or indices.

Columns: Similar structure (Date, Open, High, etc.)

Purpose: Cross-company comparison and additional model testing.

3. Demo.ipynb

Purpose: Presentation-friendly summary notebook.

Contents:

Loads data and handles missing values

Visualizes stock trends (line charts, candlestick plots)

Performs basic EDA and statistical summaries

Use Case: Ideal for demonstrations or quick reviews.

4. StockMarketProject.ipynb

Purpose: Main notebook with full model development and technical analysis.

Contents:

Data preprocessing (missing values, feature creation)

Technical indicators: Moving Averages, RSI, Bollinger Bands

ML models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM (if applicable)

Model evaluation: RMSE, MAE, predicted vs. actual plots

Use Case: For deep dive analysis and implementation.

üß∞ Steps to Run the Project

‚úÖ Dependencies

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
tensorflow or pytorch (if applicable)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution

Load either AAPL.csv or HistoricalData_*.csv

Open:

Demo.ipynb for a high-level overview, or

StockMarketProject.ipynb for full analysis and prediction

Run the notebook cells sequentially:

Preprocess ‚Üí Visualize ‚Üí Train ‚Üí Predict

‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Replace datasets with other stock data (same format)

Modify model parameters or add new features to improve accuracy
